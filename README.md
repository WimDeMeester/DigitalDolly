# DigitalDolly
Digital dolly prepares the pictures for a timelapse to mimic the movement made by a dolly.

Modern digital cameras have a resolution that exceeds the resolution of full-HD timelapse movies (1920x1080). By shooting the separate pictures in full resolution, it is possible to move inside the picture to add movement to your timelapse movies.

To run this python script, you need to have PIL (python-imaging) installed. PIL is automatically installed in python distributions like <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>. The script only works when the resolution of all images is the same (and larger than 1920x1080).

In the example below, you see the timelapse of a mountain in Austria without using DigitalDolly:

In the next example, you see the same timelapse, but the images are prepared using DigitalDolly:
