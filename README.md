# DigitalDolly
Digital dolly prepares the pictures for a timelapse to mimic the movement made by a dolly.

Modern digital cameras have a resolution that exceeds the resolution of full-HD timelapse movies (1920x1080). By shooting the separate pictures in full resolution, it is possible to move inside the picture to add movement to your timelapse movies.
